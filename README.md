# reduce-propka-workshop

A vital part of preparing a protein structure for MD simulation is adding hydrogen atoms, as the crystal structures that form the starting point for many simulation projects lack these. 'Black box' tools that come with certain MD packages can have limitations, so using a more sophisticated 3rd-party software tool to check this is always a good idea.

This short workshop illustrates the application of [Reduce](http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/lab/members.php) and [Propka](https://github.com/jensengroup/propka-3.1) to the analysis of the tautomeric and ionization states of residues in the structure of the cysteine protease cruzein (PDB code 2oz2) - the results may not be what you would have expected!

## Requirements
A basic knowledge of Python and MD simulation methods

## Training material
A Jupyter notebook and associated data files
