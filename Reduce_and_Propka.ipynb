    "# Preparing protein structures for simulation: Reduce and ProPka.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will see how you can use [Reduce](http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/software/reduce.php) and [Propka](https://github.com/jensengroup/propka-3.1) in the preparation and validation of a protein structure for molecular simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Reduce` analyses protein PDB format files and predicts the coordinates of missing hydrogen atoms. It can also correct for \"NQH flips\". However `reduce` assumes all amino acids are in their default ionization states.\n",
    "* `Propka` analyses protein PDB format files and predicts the pKas of titratable groups. From this information you can predict if a particular sidechain is likely to be ionized or not at the pH you have chosen for the simulation. However `propka` does not actually add any H-atoms to your molecular structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see what each of these two tools detects when it analyses the crystal structure of the cysteine protease cruzein (pdb code [2OZ2](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2OZ2))\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally you will see how the [PDB2PQR webserver](http://server.poissonboltzmann.org/pdb2pqr) provides a very useful way to apply both these tools to a protein structure.\n",

To the right is a unix terminal window; this is where you will execute the commands to run the `reduce` and `propka` tools, and look at the output they produce. Be aware that this unix window is connected to the CCP-BioSim cloud service - you are not running on your own laptop/desktop."

    "You will have seen that both `reduce` and `propka` tell you important things about this protein that must be taken into consideration when preparing it for simulation. But there are problems:\n",

    "* `reduce` tells you about things like delta versus epsilon tautomers of HIS residues, and produces a new PDB format file with hydrogens added, but does not analyse pKa values.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The preparation programs that come with most MD packages have the ability to correctly build  protein models if they are given a PDB format file to start with that contains the right information. This is typically encoded through modifications to the three letter residue codes for the variable amino acids. So for example, to tell a modelling program that a particular histidine residue is supposed to be the delta tautomer, you would modify the name of that residue in the PDB file from \"HIS\" to \"HID\". An epsilon tautomer would be \"HIE\" and a protonated histidine \"HIP\". There are modified names for, e.g. neutral forms of aspartic and glutamic acid as well (\"ASH\" and \"GLH\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "Between them, `reduce` and `propka` give you all the information necessary to do this, but don't actually complete the job themselves. You could edit the PDB file by hand, but the [PDB2PQR webserver](http://server.poissonboltzmann.org/pdb2pqr) can do this for you.\n",

For now, assume that is \"AMBER\" so select that in both sections below.\n",
